## 🎯 Risk Analysis Algorithm

The application uses a sophisticated keyword-based analysis:

- **High Risk Keywords** (0.25 points each): Data selling, third-party sharing, tracking
- **Medium Risk Keywords** (0.10 points each): Data collection, location access
- **Low Risk Keywords** (0.02 points each): Security measures, anonymization

Risk levels are calculated based on cumulative scores:
- **HIGH**: Score ≥ 0.5
- **MEDIUM**: Score ≥ 0.15
- **LOW**: Score < 0.15

## 🔒 Security Features

- JWT authentication with 10-hour expiration
- BCrypt password hashing
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through JPA
- Global exception handling

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- Connection pooling with HikariCP
- JPA query optimization
- File size limitations
- Efficient text processing
- Minimal frontend dependencies
